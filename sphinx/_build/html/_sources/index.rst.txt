Observing with SRT
----------------

Welcome to the user cookbook! 

These pages are intended to support the observer when
performing observations with SRT. For a complete documentation on the
user guide *Observing at SRT with Nuraghe*, please click
`here <http://discos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.

Select the **observation mode** you want, a menu with the receivers (C-,
K- and L-bands) and the associated backends (Total Power, SARDARA,
Xarcos, DFB, Roach1) will appear. You can simply follow the different steps in
order to carry out safety observations.

.. warning:: Check the update and temporary modifications before proceeding!
