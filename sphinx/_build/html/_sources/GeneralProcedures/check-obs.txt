#. On nuraghe-obs2, check that the data are correctly written in your project section :

    ``$ cd/archive/data/[projectID]/``   


#. Look at the Quick-look of the data :

    ``$ idl``             

    ``IDL> .r fitslook``

    ``IDL> fitslook``
	
    Note that the subscans are shown with a short delay in the
    quick-look plots with respect to the real observations.


#. Antenna monitors

	Check that everything section is green. If a red box appears, put the cursor on 	it and look at the error message.

	Contact and report the error messages to the responsible of the observation 		(observer friend?).

	During the tracking, @ is green while it is red during the slewing of the antenna.

	Check the update of the number of scan/subscan according to your schedule. Scans will be skipped if the target is not visible at the 		moment of the observations.

	If you realize that the scan/subscan number is frozen or that the tracking @ is red while the antenna is tracking the source, stop the 		on-going schedule with 

	``> antennaStop``    (in the operatorInput)

	then start again the schedule:

	``> antennaStart=[projectID]/…scd,n``     (with n the number of scan)

 	Sometimes, not all of the small squares of the active surface are green. Do not worry for that. Instead, it can be problematic if a 		large fraction of the active surface becomes red.


	* Check that the state of the active surface corresponds to your choice (shaped, shaped fixed, parabolic, parabolic fixed).

 	* Check the possible error messages. Try to understand the origin of the problem and to solve it. In case of persistent/complex problem, contact and report the error messages and the associated UT to the responsible of the observation (observer friend?).
